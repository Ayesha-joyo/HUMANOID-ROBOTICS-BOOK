# Introduction

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This book is designed to take you on a journey from the foundational principles of robotics and artificial intelligence to the cutting-edge integration of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in autonomous humanoid systems.

Our goal is to provide a spec-driven, hands-on approach for students, researchers, and engineers. Throughout this book, we will explore:

- **ROS 2**: The nerve center of our robotic systems.
- **Gazebo/Unity & NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: High-fidelity simulation environments for testing and development.
- **Advanced AI**: From perception and navigation to conversational AI with LLMs.
- **Real-world Applications**: Culminating in a capstone project to build an autonomous humanoid robot workflow.

All code is open-source, and every concept is backed by reproducible examples and clear, concise explanations. We hope this book serves as a valuable resource in your exploration of the exciting world of humanoid robotics.
